## üéôÔ∏è Guest Isolation Feature

The new "Guest Only" mode uses Sieve's speaker diarization API to:
1. Download the podcast video from YouTube
2. Extract audio and perform speaker diarization
3. Identify which speaker is the guest (typically speaks less than the host)
4. Return segments containing only the guest's speaking parts

### Deploy the guest isolation function:

```bash
sieve deploy isolate_guest.py
```
